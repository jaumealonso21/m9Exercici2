		<b><center>Chapter 1</center></b>
		
		<p><div align="justify">He deserves this, part of him thinks. After all, it’s 
		his fault they’re here; if only he’d tried to get along 
		with their step-mother, had tried to reason with Father, 
		had used something instead of breadcrumbs. At least Gretel 
		seemed okay – that was what mattered. He still got to see her, 
		every evening when she came with food. And it was good food… 
		too good. He made sure she took some for herself, as an 
		apology of sorts for letting her down.</div></p>

		<p><div align="justify">But sometimes all she needed was a hug, and because 
		of the wretched bars of the cage he was curled up in, 
		even that simple gesture was impossible. She was 
		knelt in front of him now, tears gushing down her 
		dirty face, and Hansel was trying to remember the 
		last time in his nine years he’d seen her cry so hard. 
		As he reached in vain to at least take hold of her shoulder, 
		he caught sight of a pair of feet at the top of a dark 
		staircase. A shrill voice started shrieking, and Gretel’s 
		eyes widened with fear as the feet began to descend 
		quickly. Before she could hide the half-eaten food, 
		a gnarled hand reached down and struck her across the face.</div></p>

		<p><div align="justify">“No!” he heard himself cry. “Leave her alone, 
		she’s only seven!” But that same hand was suddenly 
		reaching into his prison, and sharp, pointed fingernails 
		were tearing through his clothes as he desperately backed 
		away. The bars behind him felt like ice, freezing his skin 
		and making him whimper pathetically. The grip was iron-strong, 
		and he was being pulled against his will – and then suddenly 
		his eyes were stinging from the heat of the fire, and the 
		sound of screaming reverberated round his skull.</div></p>

		<p><div align="justify">Except it wasn’t him screaming; it was her. It was 
		the hag, her face pressed up against the oven window,
		wrinkled skin reddening as it blistered. When her gums 
		started to bleed, Hansel grabbed his sister’s hand and 
		fled. He took her out into the cold, running at full pelt, 
		as though the witch would be on his heels if he looked over
		his shoulder, burns and blood and all. He had to get away – 
		he had to get Gretel away.</div></p>

		<p><div align="justify">“Hansel!”</div></p>

		<p><div align="justify">The witch could take him, but not her.</div></p>

		<p><div align="justify">“Hansel wait!”</div></p>

		<p><div align="justify">She was too young. He should have made her go with Father!</div></p>

		<p><div align="justify">“Slow down! You’re going too fast!”</div></p>

		<p><div align="justify">“Don’t stop, Gretel!” he called out to her. “You mustn’t stop running!”</div></p>

		<p><div align="justify">“But I’m tired!”</div></p>

		<p><div align="justify">“I’m not going to let her hurt you.” He stopped in his tracks, 
		pushing her small body ahead of him. “Go! Keep running!” And 
		she did; and Hansel watched as his sister disappeared into 
		the dark trees, vaguely wondering why he wasn’t going with her.</div></p>

		<p><div align="justify">Then he heard them: the whispers, the snuffles, the breaking 
		twigs. His heart pounded, even as he felt all the blood drain 
		from his face. There were worse things out there than witches… 
		and he’d just sent his sister into their jaws.</div></p>

		<p><div align="justify">“Gretel!”</div></p>

		<p><center>***</center></p>

		<p><div align="justify">From her own bed, Gretel watched sadly as her brother twitched 
		and grunted in fitful sleep. Frowning, she drew her knees up 
		under her chin with a sigh, wishing there was something she could do. 
		It was too early yet to tell whether he would wake up from this 
		nightmare or not. If he did, then maybe she’d be able to help. 
		She knew what he would say: that she was only sixteen, that he 
		should be able to take care of himself as well as her. It was 
		those times that Gretel wanted to smack her brother for being 
		so big-headed and prideful. What kind of sister would she be if 
		she didn’t help the only sibling she had ever known? The only 
		person who had ever cared about her?</div></p>

		<p><div align="justify">Hansel jerked suddenly, and Gretel couldn’t take it; not caring 
		for stealth she slipped out of the bed and stepped across to his, 
		sitting on the edge against his back (he was hot – she could feel 
		the heat radiating off him before she even sat down). Carefully, 
		she reached out and rested her hand on his head, stroking his hair 
		tenderly like she vaguely remembered their mother doing – their real 
		mother. It seemed to take forever, but soon Hansel was leaning into 
		the touch, his breathing steady, muscles relaxed. He’d rolled over so 
		that he was facing her, and his head was nearly in her lap; if she 
		wanted him to stay this deeply asleep, Gretel knew she’d have to 
		remain where she was and forsake sleep herself. It didn’t matter, 
		she decided. Hansel would do the same for her in a heartbeat.</div></p>
